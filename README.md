# Graph Generator Server

## Running the server

1. Before anything check the list of pre-requisites.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Move to the root directory (of the repository) and run the `setup.sh` file. 
4. If everything goes well, you should be able to start the server with the `start.sh` file.

## Using the Server

Now for the diagrams to show up, the server has to see your diagram contents, and the generated diagram should somehow appear on your screen. So we have developed a couple of ways of making this happen. But if we are missing something feel free to file an issue.

### 1. Through Supported Extensions.
> Before anything, shortcomings : Anyone who views your file have to have these externals tools installed. Otherwise its pretty non-intrusive.

### 2. By Embedding Diagram File Urls.
> Before anything, shortcomings : These diagram files should be visible to the `graph-generator` server.
